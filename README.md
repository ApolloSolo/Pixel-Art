# Pixel-Art
A relaxing pixel art game
This project started out as trying to add and remove divs just through JavaScript and not in HTML. Then, an expansion of ideas and layering of concepts lead to this little game. Expanding this game, Iâ€™d like to have three pages, one for full monitor screens, and another for mobile users. There are also an issue with not accessing older pixels once new pixels are created. Otherwise, please take a relaxing moment to enjoy doodling with some pixel art.
